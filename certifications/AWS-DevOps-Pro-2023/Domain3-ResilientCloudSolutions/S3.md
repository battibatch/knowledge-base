# S3

## Replication
CRR - Cross region replication
SRR - same region replication

set up async replication
must enabled versioning in source and destination
buckets can be in different AWS accounts
Copying is async
IAM permission to S3

Use case
* CRR - compliance, lower latency access
* SRR - log aggregation, live replication between test/prod accounts

can limit scope of what is replicated in S3 bucket

it is not retroactive, only for new object
* but it will prompt for a batch script to do all the existing objects

Delete marker replication
* if I delete a file, in origin, it will be deleted in replica
* if permanent delete of origin object, it is not replicated
