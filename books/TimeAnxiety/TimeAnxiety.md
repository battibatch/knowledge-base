## Chapter 01: Start by Giving Yourself More Time

Anxiety inhibits your ability to think clearly in the moment

Actions
1. Practice "Time decluttering" - remove items from your calendar
2. Put a brick in your inbox - Turn off ways you can be accessed. Resist the expectation that your attention os up for grabs.
* remove time-wasting apps from phone
* Turn off all but essential notifications
* Do not agree to requests and commitments w/o thinking


## Chapter 02: Cognitive Distortions

Over-generalization - seeing 1 bad outcome as a never ending pattern of failure
Black/white thinking - no middle ground
Filtering - focus only on negative
Personalization - thinking everything bad that happens is your fault

These distortions can lead to procrastination, over-committing, neglecting self-care

Label and Challenge these thoughts and create a counterstatement
