## Chapter 01: Start by Giving Yourself More Time

Anxiety inhibits your ability to think clearly in the moment

Actions
1. Practice "Time decluttering" - remove items from your calendar

## Chapter 02: Cognitive Distortions

Over-generalization - seeing 1 bad outcome as a never ending pattern of failure

These distortions can lead to procrastination, over-committing, neglecting self-care

Label and Challenge these thoughts and create a counterstatement
