# Zero To One Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future
Thiel, Peter
2014

Zero To One is about how to build companies that create new things

## Chapter 01: The Challenge of the Future

"what important truth do few people agree with you on?" 
Future of progress
* horizontal is going from 1 to n, coping things that work
    * Globalization is horizontal
* Vertical is goin from 0 to 1
    * technology is vertical

New Technology has never been an automatic feature of history
Our current society is similar to the 60s b/c we are distracted to come up with new tech

Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuffy done, but you als need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

## Chapter 02: Party Like its 1999

COnventional beliefs only ever come to appear arbitrary and wrong in retrospect

Author suggests the dot com bubble replaced technology with globalization

Lessons learned:
1. Make incremental advances
2. Stay Lean and Flexible. Lean == unplanned; iterate, and learn
3. Improve on the competition. Don try to create a new market prematurely
4. Focus on Product, not sales. If you product requires salespeople or advertising, it is not good enough

There are opposing principles though
1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality
2. a bad plan is better than no plan
3. competitive markets destroy profits
4. sale matters just as much as product


## Chapter 03: All Happy Companies Are Different

What valuable company is nobody building?

Even big businesses can be bad - airlines make $0.37 per passenger trip.

goal is to become a monopoly - so good at what you do, no other company can compete.

If you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business

"In business, money is either an important thing, or it is everything"

In a static world, monopolies are bad; but we live in a dynamic world
* creative monopolist give customers more choices by adding new categories
