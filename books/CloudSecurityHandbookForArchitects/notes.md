## Chapter 01: Evolution of Cloud Computing and Impact on Security

History

NIST defines cloud as 
* On-demand
* Broad network access
* Resource Pooling
* Quick elasticity
* Metered Service

Cloud Types
* Public - AWS
* Private exclusive data center owned by a business
* Hybrid
* Multi-cloud

Service Model
* SaaS
* PaaS 
* IaaS

Justifications
* agility
* selections
* Collaboration
* low cost

Analyzing Risk and reduce risk w/
* Certifications ans standards
* data protections
* Access control
* BC and DR
* Encryption
* Audits and Alerts
* File Sharing

Privacy Concerns
* data privacy
* data loss
* Geographical data storage
* multi tenant 
* transparency problems
* Hypervisors
* Admin problems

Shadow IT is a real problem

Shared Responsibility is important


## Chapter 02: Understanding the Core Principles of Cloud Security and its Importance

Least privilege
Defense in depth
Assess risk w/ asset focused strategy
Segregation of duties
Fail-safe
* default deny in event of failure
Economy of mechanism - Keep it simple
Complete risk mediation, not matter state (init, shutdown, etc.) 
Open Design
* suggesting that releasing cloud securiy designs are better if opened; but this is only true if they are well reviewed
Least common mechanism
* the need for many users share a minimum number os secure measures
Weakest link
Making use of current landscape
* separate resources to avoid sprawl in a breach
Architectural considerations will be influenced by: 
* regulatory requirements
* compliance
* security management
Controls
* access controls
* service levels

Information classification
* Public, Sensitive, Private, Confidential
* Criteria: Value, age, useful life, personal association

Procedures for classifying data
1. determine the admin and custodian of data
2. outline standards for for categorizing
3, Sort info according to the owner
4. Specify any exceptions
5. Specify the checks used for each classification level
6. Describe the declassification procedures
7. Develop a program to educate the company

Use IAM
Certificates
passwords/phrases
MFA

After Identity, is access control based in ID

Best practices
* Protect endpoints
* IAM
* create and enforce Guidelines
* Secure data at rest and in motion
* Intrusion detection and prevention
* audits and pen testing
