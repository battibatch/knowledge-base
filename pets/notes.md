**Safe data**: data is treated to protect any confidentiality concerns.
**Safe projects**: research projects are approved by data owners for the public good.
**Safe people**: researchers are trained and authorized to use data safely.
**Safe settings**: a SecureLab environment prevents unauthorized use.
**Safe outputs**: screened and approved outputs that are non-disclosive.

## Synthetic Data

## Differential Privacy
A mathematical method used in data analysis that introduces noise into query responses, making it harder to pinpoint individual data points. Differential privacy is specifically about determining the precise amount of noise needed to achieve statistical privacy assurance. Differential privacy employs aggregations to balance data analysis with privacy preservations. This technique involved summarizing and generalizing data to derive meaningful insights while protecting individual privacy.
