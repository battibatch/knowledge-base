# CI/CD Metrics

## Deployment Metrics
- Deployment Frequency: Number of deployments per day/week/month.
- Deployment Lead Time: Average time from commit to deployment in production.
- Deployment Success Rate: Percentage of deployments completed successfully.
- Deployment Failure Rate: Percentage of deployments that fail in production or rollback.
- Rollback Rate: Frequency of rollbacks after deployments.

## Quality & Stability Metrics
- Change Failure Rate: Percentage of code changes resulting in hotfixes or incidents.
- Defect Rate: Number of defects found post-deployment per deployment.
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD): Average time to detect a failure or incident after deployment.
- Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR): Average time required to recover from an incident or deployment failure.

## Testing and Coverage Metrics
- Test Coverage: Percentage of code covered by automated tests (unit, integration, e2e).
- Test Pass Rate: Percentage of tests passing per build.
- Flaky Test Rate: Number of intermittent or unstable tests per run.
- Test Execution Time: Duration of automated test suites per stage.

## Build & Integration Metrics
- Build Duration: Average build time for each pipeline stage.
- Build Success Rate: Percentage of successful builds vs. total builds.
- Build Frequency: Number of builds triggered per day/week.
- Merge/Integration Frequency: Number of successful integrations or merges per day/week.
- Code Merge Lead Time: Average time between pull request creation and merge.

## Pipeline Efficiency Metrics
- Cycle Time: Time taken from starting development of a feature to its deployment.
- Queue Time: Average wait time before a job starts execution.
- Pipeline Stability: Rate of pipeline failures caused by infrastructure or configuration issues.
- Parallelism Level: Number of pipeline stages running concurrently to improve throughput.

## Resource & Cost Metrics
- Infrastructure Utilization: Percentage utilization of pipeline infrastructure resources (CPU, memory, storage).
- Cost per Deployment: Average financial cost of each deployment.
- Idle Resource Time: Time spent by CI/CD resources in idle state.

## Security & Compliance Metrics
- Security Scan Frequency: Frequency of automated security scans per release.
- Vulnerability Detection Rate: Number and severity of vulnerabilities identified per build.
- Security Scan Pass Rate: Percentage of builds passing all security checks.
- Compliance Adherence: Number of builds/releases compliant with defined security policies.

## Developer Experience Metrics
- Developer Feedback Time: Time developers wait for pipeline feedback (success/failure notifications).
- Pipeline Usability: Frequency and nature of complaints or issues reported by developers regarding pipeline usability.
- Documentation Quality: Completeness, accuracy, and freshness of pipeline and build documentation.

## Continuous Improvement Metrics
- Improvement Implementation Rate: Frequency and speed of pipeline improvements or feature additions.
- Incident & Feedback Responsiveness: Speed and effectiveness of addressing pipeline-related incidents or developer feedback.
- Automation Rate: Proportion of manual tasks vs. automated tasks in the CI/CD pipeline.
