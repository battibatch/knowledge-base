In DevSecOps, the "Sec" stands for "Security." DevSecOps is a set of practices and principles that integrates security into the DevOps (Development and Operations) process. The goal of DevSecOps is to ensure that security is not treated as a separate phase or consideration but is instead integrated throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from design and development to testing and deployment.
