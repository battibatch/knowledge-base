# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a knowledge base repository containing technical documentation, book notes, certification study materials, and DevSecOps resources. The repository is organized into several main categories:

- **books/**: Book summaries and notes with accompanying images
- **certifications/**: Study materials for AWS DevOps Pro and Kubernetes certifications
- **cd/**: Continuous delivery documentation
- **ci/**: Continuous integration resources including Jenkins pipelines
- **devsecops/**: Security-focused DevOps documentation and compliance materials
- **misc/**: General architecture and organizational content
- **notes/**: Technical notes and tutorials
- **pets/**: Privacy Enhancing Technologies notes
- **playbooks/**: Operational playbooks and procedures

## File Structure and Conventions

### Documentation Format
- Primary documentation format is Markdown (.md files)
- Book notes follow a standardized template structure (see `books/template.md`)
- Images are stored alongside their corresponding markdown files with descriptive names (image.png, image-1.png, etc.)
- Chapter-based organization for book content with hierarchical headings

### Content Organization
- Each book/topic has its own subdirectory under the relevant category
- Supporting materials (images, code samples) are co-located with documentation
- Certification materials are organized by domain/topic areas
- Technical content includes both theoretical concepts and practical implementations

## Content Types

### Book Notes
- Follow template structure with title, author, year
- Chapter-based organization with numbered topics
- Include practical insights and key takeaways
- Reference images inline where relevant

### Certification Materials
- AWS DevOps Professional organized by 6 domains
- Kubernetes Admin materials focus on cluster components
- Service-specific documentation with practical examples

### DevSecOps Resources
- Security compliance frameworks (ISO27001, SOC2)
- Threat modeling and continuous compliance
- CI/CD security integration patterns
- Cloud security maturity models

### Infrastructure Documentation
- Jenkins pipeline examples and patterns
- Application architecture patterns
- Branching strategies and Git workflows
- Monitoring and observability practices

## Working with This Repository

When adding new content:
- Use the established directory structure
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Include relevant images in the same directory as markdown files
- Maintain consistent heading structures for easy navigation
- Reference related content where appropriate

When editing existing content:
- Preserve the established format and structure
- Update related documentation if changes affect multiple areas
- Maintain consistency with existing content style and organization
